# note_taker-with_Express.js

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create an application that has the ability to create, save and delete notes with a note taker. This application uses Express.js on the back end and saves and retieves user generated note data from JSON file. The Note Taker application allows you to enter in the title and text on your note taker app and save the items as a way to keep track of tasks. The application's front end was previously created and as a developer, it was my responsibility to build the back end and connect the two, then deploy completed application to Heroku.
